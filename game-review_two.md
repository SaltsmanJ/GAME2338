# Game Review for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3

## Details

### Game Title
Call of Duty: Black Ops 3

### Rating
I rate games from 1 star to five stars, and I give this game 4 stars.

## Summary
This game is about a Black Ops agent that has survived a traumatic experience and is continues their line of work. This game takes place on earth in an advanced technological era. You start the game before the traumatic experience happens on a mission to rescue an important political prisoner, afterwards you are rescued and given a Direct Nueral Interface(DNI).

The game mechanics are different from other Call of Duty games in that you have a HUD that can be switched from regular vision to a tactical mode which highlights any enemies you or your allied NPC's can see and displays information like what kind of enemy it is and thair distance from the player. It also has an extra set of abilities called cybercore abilities that the palyer can use to get a tactical advantage against enemies. 

The movement mechanics in the game are mostly standard with a basic jump and sprint mechanic. However, there are upgrades called tac rigs that the player can equip in their loadouts that allows them to enhance their mobility with things like wall-running and double-jumping. There are also environmental mobility pieces like ziplines that the palyer can use with "Z-tracs".

## Final Thoughts
I liked that the loadout is customizable for your preferrd mobility level, however I don't like that some of the controls, like the ones for you cybercore abilities, aren't as intuitive as they could be.
