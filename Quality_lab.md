#The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (SNES Version)
  * I think this game is quality because of it's reliability and it's efficiency. This is because the SNES cartidges were very efficient with their code, and the game behaved and played consistently.
  
 #Final Fantasy Seven
  * I think this game is quality becuse of the integrity and usability. Despite being played across four disks, access to the code was very limited, and the game was very easy to learn and play.
  
 #Castlevania: Symphony of the Night
  * I think this game is quality because of the correctness and the reliability of the game. This is because the game was translated and moved very well from the Japanese version, and behaved consistently when you played it.
