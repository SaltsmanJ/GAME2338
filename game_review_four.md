# Game Review for Street Dice

## Details

### Game Title
Street dice can be found on the IOS app store.

### Rating
I ratre games from 1 to 5 stars and I give this game 1 star.

## Summary
This game is an app version of the dice game street craps. It follows the same rules as street craps and is a very small download. This makes it a quick an easy game to get and play. 

The controls for the game are simple, you position the dice and then tap the screen to lock them in place. Then you can either tap the screen again to bring up a power arrow or you can swipe to roll the dice. Following this, you repeat the process.

This game is free and you don't use any real money in the game when you make the bets. There is an in game shop that uses the games cash to unlock customization options for the dice and the background.

## Final Thoughts
The only thing i likeed about this game was how quickly I could download it. The dice-rolling physics didn't really work and the game doesn't play very smoothly. The graphics also don't seem to line up properly with some of the things you can see going on in the game.
