### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 5 stars and I rate this game 4 stars.

## Summary
Raft is a survival game in which you are drifting on the ocean. Throughout the game, you build make your raft bigger and add better survival tools for things like food and water. You'll also repair the raft throughout the game as a shark circles, follows, and attacks you raft throughout the game along with some other creatures you'll encounter. 

Throughout the game, you'll craft various tools like hooks you use for gathering materials from the ocean, shovels, and fishing rods. Using these, you'll collect more materials to build things like grills, water purifiers, and smelters. Then you can make more materials to build better things and make food and water faster and more abundantly.

As you drift, you'll come across islands you can explore to find more resources to create better tools, as well as animals like sheep. Eventually, you will be able to build a radar to see any islands in the areaand their size in order to determine if you want to visit them or continue drifting by.

## Final Thoughts
I liked the size and material collection of the game, however, I didn't like that the shark and other creatures can destroy parts of your raft and that anything on that part will be permanently lost and there will be no materials dropped by their destruction. Otherwise the game is really fun to play. Overall, this is a game I would recommend to others.
