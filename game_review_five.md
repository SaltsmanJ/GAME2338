# Game Review for Ascension

## Details

### Game Title
Ascension is a deck-building game on the IOS app store.

### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 5 stars, and I give this game 5 stars.

## Summary
This game is about building a deck to earn stars from a predetermined number in a pool. Each player starts off with the same cards to start the game, but as the game progresses players will pick up cards from a center pool of five cards that are face up. Every time a card is removed from the center pool another one is added from the deck. The game ends when the pool of stars is empty and no more can be earned from it. 

There are multiple different card types and factions. The most basic of cards generate either gems, which are used to get other cards from the pool, or attack points, which are used to defeat monsters that are mixed in throughout the deck and offer stars and helpful effects. The basic factions are Enlightened, Lifebound, Mechana, and Void. In each faction there are two types of cards, heroes and constructs. These cards have a variety of effects and can generate extra attack or extra gems. 

Each faction focuses more to specific tasks. The Mechana focus mostly on getting constucts on the field, while the Void faction focuses more on generating Attack. The enlightend focus mostly on drawing more cards from your stock that you place cards that you get from the center, while the Lifebound faction focus on getting extra gems and extra cards for free.

## Final Thoughts
I really like the way this game plays, however I don't like how slow things can be when playing the game. Overall, the mechanics and gameplay are very well planned and executed. As a result, I find this game to be very fun and would recommend it to tother people.
