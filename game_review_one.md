## Details

### Game Title
Hyper Light Drifter.

### Rating
I rate this game 4 out of 5 stars.
## Summary
  This game is about a character called the drifter. The story leads you through his journey to cure himself of a strange illness. It takes place on a planet after an apocalyptic war has destroyed much of civilisation. All of the information in the game is conveyed through images .
  The movement mechanics in the game are unique in that you a have a dash which allows you to travel over empty ssapce that would otherwise be impassable without a similar mechanic. This is a much used ability and can be upgraded multiple times if you wish to do so. The other part of this mechanic that makes it unique is if you are playing with a mouse and keyboard the dash will always move towards the cursor so you may not always dash in the direction you are facing or moving.
  The combat mechanics are a free flow combat in the screen area with a dynamic evironment that will change and limit the space you can fight in. The weapons you sart with intially is a sword that you can upgrade to get more abilities for it. As you continue the game you will find different guns that you can use and upgrade as well.

## Final Thoughts
I really like this game. The base concept of not entirely knowing what has hapened and what is going on in the world is always great to see because it leves a lot of room for player interpretation. One of the features I don't like about the game is that when dashing it can be very easy to lose track of your cursor and so miss your target and fall, or dash into an enemy attack.
