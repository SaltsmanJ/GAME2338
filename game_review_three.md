### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 5 stars and I give this game five stars.

## Summary
This game is a simple racing game with a track and car editor. You can play both online and solo and there is a variety of different modes that you can play in the game.  This includes a one lap race mode, an obstacle course mode, and an endurance race mode among others. 

The controls for the game are very simple. You use the arrow keys to accelerate, reverse, and turn. This gives the game an older feel to it compared to most games that use the WASD movement binding. The controls for restarting the race or returning your car to spicific points on the track are also very simple. Instead of having to pause the game in order to restart the race you can simply press the backspace key to restart the race ande to respawn you simply press enter.

The track editor is very easy to use. There are two different modes for it, simple or advanced. The simple mode gives you acces to some basic track pieces and allows basic track building. The advanced mode gives you acces to all the track pieces and allows you to build tracks however you like. In both modes you can move, rotate, and raise or lower track pieces, which allows you to make complex race tracks even with the simple mode.

## Final Thoughts
Overall, I enjoyed playing this game and didn't find anything I really disliked about it. The controls were very simple and easy to use and the gameplay itself was fun, even in solo mode.  The track editor was also vey easy to learn and use, and creating more tracks to race on was just as much fun as the rest of the game.
